# GoCI

GoCI is a continuous integration server for go that has support for
github/bitbucket/google code post commit hooks on projects that have
the layout like a gopath or projects that are packages in the main directory
(regular, go gettable projects).

# Status

GoCI is no longer maintained and the service has been shut down. You should
use travis-ci now.
